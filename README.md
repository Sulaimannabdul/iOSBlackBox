A collection of SSL reverse attack in a variety of languages, including C, C++, and about iOS Application Security and Penetration Testing.
In Apple's code, there was an extra "goto" statement. This caused the verification process to be bypassed. Because of this bug, attackers could potentially intercept and read the data being transmitted.
